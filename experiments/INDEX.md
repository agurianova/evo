## Heilbron

| Experiment | Status | Key Finding | PR |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----|
| `heilbron/adversarial-v2` | ✅ Complete | SUGGESTIVE POSITIVE — K=3 bidirectional feedback marginal (+0.00038 actual_fitness); K=1 regressed below baseline; Im... | #188 |
| `heilbron/adversarial-dynamic-updates` | ✅ Complete | NEGATIVE — archive re-eval hurts actual_fitness (-0.011 gap); GAN resistance gaming confirmed; all cells below baseline | #197 |
| `heilbron/baseline-repro` | ✅ Complete | SUGGESTIVE — baseline reproducible on best-overall (mean=0.03449 vs 0.03464); Constructor-only CI wide; 3 near-Q_MAX ... | #201 |
| `heilbron/asymmetric-iterations` | ✅ Complete | NEUTRAL (between arms) — Both feedback modes produced >=105% SOTA (0.03648, 0.03650). Composition vs gradient-in-prompt equivalent (delta 0.00081). K=5 NOT tested (K=1 amendment). Source code access accelerates early optimization. | #204 |
| `heilbron/asymmetric-iterations-v2` | ✅ Complete | INCONCLUSIVE — Replication with bug fixes. Feedback mode NULL (cross-arm delta 0.00066). Best max(G,D)=0.03588 (C1, 104% baseline). v2 underperformed v1 despite 4-6x more gens; min_delta sync fix identified as hidden confound. | #206 |
| `heilbron/k5-budget-v3` | ✅ Complete | INCONCLUSIVE — K=3 vs K=5 HoF-lag effect -0.00164 [-0.00393, +0.00065] 95% CI; K3_1 pair deadlocked on ProgressBasedSyncHook at gen 29/50; v3 2D MAP-Elites eliminated D fitness collapse (all D fitness > 0.50). N=2 underpowered. | (branch `exp/heilbron/k5-budget-v3`; PR not yet opened) |
| `heilbron/adversarial-repro-v1` | ✅ Complete | NULL — v1 recipe under bug-fixed library; mean best-ever actual_fitness 0.0341 [0.0306, 0.0377] 95% CI, in v2/baseline band (< v1=0.03574). A1_G reached 0.0365 evolutionarily (earliest at gen=5 during I-16-broken phase, D-to-G feedback inactive). Confound: `redis.resume=false` does not flush Redis, so broken-phase programs persisted post-relaunch. Systemic bugs discovered: I-17 CompositionInjectionHook mis-labels injected programs as `gen=1/iter=0/is_root=True` (fixed this experiment); relaunch protocol must flush DBs, not rely on resume flag. | #211 |
| `heilbron/adversarial-repro-v2` | ✅ Complete | NULL — Stacked treatments (SharedBenchmarkFilteredLineageStage on D + SOFTMAX opponent sampling on G + I-16/I-17 fixes) produced no lift. μ_G=0.03315 [0.03001, 0.03630] 95% CI, Δ=-0.10pp vs v1 baseline 0.03413 (Welch t=-0.530, p=0.692). One outlier (C1_G=0.03650 SOTA-level), other three G runs averaged 0.03203. D collapse persists (2/4 D runs fitness=0.000) despite SBF-Lineage. Early-terminated at ~23h (G gens 36-55 vs 200 target — comparable to v1 horizon). I-18 discovered (cosmetic frontier-plot bug, fixed). Strengthens REDESIGN-first priority: information-flow improvements cannot overcome D hard-floor fitness structural defect. | #216 |
| `heilbron/d-tanh-no-lineage` | ✅ Complete | SUGGESTIVE — D-tanh smoothing + D-side LineageStage removal: C arm crossed v2 NULL band (C1_G=0.03538, +0.00223 vs v2 NULL 0.03315, 96.9% of v1 SOTA); A arm did not (A1_G=0.03124, NULL). Grand mean μ_G=0.03331 formally NULL against pre-reg thresholds; verdict upgraded to SUGGESTIVE because C1_G surpassed all post-bug-fix G runs. Mechanistic finding (clean): D/G gen-pace ratio recovered from d-smoothing-minimal's 0.54x to 1.22-1.55x — LineageStage was the dominant timing bottleneck. D fitness healthy under tanh (0% invalidity, fitness 0.525-0.637, breaking 10-experiment hard-floor stagnation pattern). Limitations: N=1 per arm (8→4 reduction for proxy-load mitigation), early stop at gen 38-59/200 when C arm crossed (optional-stopping confound), 2-IV gap (cannot attribute lift to no-lineage alone vs combined with tanh). Pre-registered bootstrap CI on 4 G runs not executable. Replication needed (N=2 C arm Priority 1). | #223 |
| `heilbron/v1-honest-repro` | ✅ Complete | SUGGESTIVE (lean H₁) — v1 setup (binary G resistance + linear D scoring + SBF disabled) on current main does NOT cleanly reproduce v1 SOTA. μ_G=0.03398 [0.03282, 0.03515] 95% CI; v1 baseline mean 0.03574 outside upper bound; 0/4 G runs ≥ 0.0364 (SOTA threshold) and 0/4 ≥ 0.03574 (partial-reproduction threshold). Frontier across all 8 runs: A1_D=0.03547. C1_G/C2_G plateaued (no improvement over 28-41 gens); A1_G/A2_G still ascending. Early-terminated at G gen ~54 / D gen ~84 (vs pre-reg max=200) — caveat against firm NEGATIVE call. Deviations: I-03 dg_tracker=null launch-time fix (more faithful to v1, no confound); I-04 yaml quote-stripping (operational); I-06 LiteLLM proxy hang (Pattern 10); I-07 post-recovery process wedge. Implication: 300+ commits of library drift between commit 562a1210 (v1) and 25470e37 (current main) are load-bearing — points to engine churn beyond the 17-decision interview, not the binary/linear landscape itself. | #224 |
