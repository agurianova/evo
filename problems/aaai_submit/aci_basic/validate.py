"""DirectEvolve arm of the matched ACI study: repeated seeded solve() calls.

The grading lives in problems.aaai_submit._harness.benchmarks.aci_grading, shared with the improve and
mixed arms. This arm has no incumbent, so it runs run_direct rather than the
two-stage controller -- under the same wall clock, the same sandbox, the same seed
schedule and the same acceptance rule.
