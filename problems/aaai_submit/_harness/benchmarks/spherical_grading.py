"""Grade one spherical candidate program. Every arm of the matched study lands here.

The hex analogue of this file grades ONE instance. This one grades a SET — the 14
development configurations from the manifest — because a single instance cannot carry
the generalisation claim the resubmission needs, and that is the whole reason the
benchmark moved. The set is read from the manifest, so the three arms cannot end up
evolving on different configurations.

Everything that could decide the outcome — the controller, the intensity ladder, the
per-config budget, the sandbox, the seed schedule, the verifier, the accept rule, and
the warm start itself — is this file, once. The three problem packages under
problems/spherical_<arm> differ in exactly one line: which adapter wraps the evolved
class.

THE SCORE IS SIGNED, AND IT IS SCORED ON THE PROPOSAL, NOT ON THE INCUMBENT.

Beating Cohn is the hard part of this benchmark; most of a run is spent below the
baseline. The published score cannot see down there, for two compounding reasons, and
both had to go:

  The floor. The shipped grader scores max(0, relative reduction of mu). Non-improvement
  is worth nothing, so every arm that has not yet won reads exactly 0.0 and the search
  climbs a flat surface.

  The incumbent. Removing the floor alone changes NOTHING, which is the part that is
  easy to get wrong: the incumbent is pre-seeded with Cohn and promotion is strictly
  better, so `mu_best` can never come out above the baseline and the floor never fires
  in the first place. The score has to be taken from the best mu a proposal was
  VALIDATED at — promoted or not — for the sign to ever be negative.

So `fitness` is 100 * mean over configs of the SIGNED relative reduction of the best
validated proposal's mu. Above the baseline it is identical to the published score. Below
it, it keeps resolving: an arm closing on Cohn and an arm nowhere near it are now
different numbers, and evolution has a gradient to climb the whole way up.

A config where the arm validated NOTHING scores as mu = 1.0, the worst code that is
still valid (two coincident points). Not as 0.0 — that would make silence worth more
than a bad attempt, and a search told that will learn to be silent. It is bounded for
the same reason: mu <= 1 and mu_cohn >= 0.15 everywhere in the snapshot, so the worst
attainable score on the development panel is -118.1 and INVALID_FITNESS sits below it.

`gain_floored` is the published number, kept so the campaign's figures stay comparable.
`mean_mu` is the ACCEPTED coherence — the physical quantity the paper reports against
Cohn's table — and it is pinned at the baseline unless the arm actually won.
