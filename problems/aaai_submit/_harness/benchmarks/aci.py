"""Independent ACI optimizer benchmark: maximize C = ||f*f||_2^2 / (||f*f||_1 ||f*f||_inf).

The controller's view of the second autocorrelation inequality as a search target.
Config is a length-N nonnegative array f on a 1-D grid; the objective is C(f), and a
run maximizes it from the trivial constant seed (C=2/3) toward the AlphaEvolve record
(C=0.96102). This is the ACI analogue of `benchmarks/hex.py::HexBenchmark`.

The C convention and its validity checks are LIFTED from `verifier.py` (co-located)
(calibrated 2026-07-18 against both published anchors to ~1e-15) rather than re-derived:
a second convention here could silently disagree with the record the arms chase, and a
verifier that shared the optimizer's own metric could be gamed by it. `compute_c`
returns None where `verifier.verify` raises, because the controller's contract is
objective-or-None and an infeasible proposal is a normal event in a search, not an error.
