"""Grade one hex candidate program. Every arm of the matched study lands here.

The instance is the manifest's, not this file's: `problems/hex<N>_*` and the prompts
are both named off `evolution_instances`, so an instance change moves the packages,
the prompts and the grader together or it does not happen at all.

The three problem packages under `problems/hex<N>_*` differ in exactly one line:
which adapter wraps the evolved class. Everything that could decide the outcome —
the controller, the sigma ladder, the wall-clock budget, the sandbox, the seed
schedule, the verifier, the accept rule — is this file, once. A validator that
carried its own copy of any of them would turn Experiment A into a comparison of
validators.

`proposals`, `accepted` and `valid_rate` are reported as metrics because they are
what answers the reviewer's objection to the DirectEvolve baseline: a basic arm
reporting proposals=1 is crippled, and the number has to be visible to say it
isn't. They are diagnostics only — the fitness the search optimizes is -L.
