"""Supervised execution of LLM-generated candidate code.

Candidate code is untrusted in the specific sense that it was written by a model
and never read by a human: it may loop forever, fork, exhaust memory, print
megabytes, crash the interpreter, or return something that cannot be serialized.
Any of those must cost the run one proposal, not the run.

The candidate lives in a SPAWNED worker — a fresh interpreter that rebuilds the
program from its pickled class — and never in a forked one. That is not a
stylistic choice:

  * Importing a candidate that uses JAX starts ~440 threads in the importing
    process, and forking from a multithreaded process deadlocks the child (JAX
    prints the warning itself). GigaEvo hands `validate()` a class that has
    ALREADY been unpickled, so the grading process is already poisoned before the
    first proposal. A fork-based cage therefore hangs on proposal 0 for every
    JAX candidate — including the five programs that produced the published
    ImprovEvolve numbers.
  * The worker OUTLIVES the proposal, so the program keeps its JIT cache between
    calls, exactly as it did when the published pipeline ran it in-process.
    Re-spawning per proposal would charge a JAX program its ~3 s of compilation
    on all ~175 calls and hand the numpy-family arms an advantage the method
    never had.

Memory is capped by RESIDENT size, polled by the parent — not by RLIMIT_AS.
Address space is not memory: jaxlib maps ~50 GiB of it while its resident set
stays under a gigabyte, so an address-space cap of any defensible size aborts
every JAX candidate at import with SIGABRT.

The sandbox stays benchmark-free. It decides whether a proposal *ran*; whether
the config it produced is feasible is a validator's job, so values like NaN pass
through untouched rather than being silently rejected here.
