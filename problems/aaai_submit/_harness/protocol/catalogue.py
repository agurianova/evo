"""The frozen Cohn warm start: the one configuration all three arms begin from.

This is the most load-bearing input in Experiment A. Every arm starts here, and the
floored fitness is measured against this configuration's mu, so if the coordinates and
the mu ever disagree the whole comparison is scored against a baseline that does not
exist.

They can disagree, because they live in different places. `mu_cohn` is frozen in
`protocol/cohn_snapshot.json`, which is in git. The COORDINATES are
not: they sit in problems/spherical_codes_improver_general/cohn_cache/, which is
generated data, gitignored, and re-downloaded on a miss from a catalogue the manifest
already records as having moved since the freeze (catalogue_snapshot_is_dated_not_current).
A cold cache on run day would silently hand every arm a different warm start than the
mu they are graded against, and nothing downstream would notice.

So the snapshot's per-config `packing_sha256` is enforced as a gate rather than kept as
a record: the cached bytes are hashed and must match, and the mu recomputed from them
must match the frozen mu. A miss is a hard failure, never a re-download — a run that
quietly refetched would produce numbers against an undeclared baseline.

The mu cross-check is also what licenses this module parsing the packings itself
instead of importing the grader's loader: if this parser disagreed with the one that
built the snapshot, the recomputed mu would not match to 1e-12 and the gate would fire.
